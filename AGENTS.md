# SonarQube secrets scanning for files protocol

Before reading any file in this workspace, scan it for secrets with the deterministic scanner:

```bash
sonar analyze secrets <path/to/file>
```

If the command reports that the file contains a secret, **do not read the file**. Instead:

1. Inform the user that the file appears to contain a secret or credential and that reading it would expose the value in chat history, logs, and any downstream telemetry.
2. Advise them to rotate the leaked credential at its source of truth and remove it from the file.
3. Do not proceed with the original request until the secret has been removed.
